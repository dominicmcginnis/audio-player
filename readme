This is a from a tutorial on building a custom Audio player.  The code was pulled from http://r.osey.me/code/audio/ and then modified as it was studied.

Modifications - todo
1.  Create a servlet hosting an API to return
	a) Random Songs to play along with title and image content
	b) Potential event info from StubHub with a link to the event if the person wants to purchase
2.  Servlet must:
	a) Take a call for next song (genre???)
	b) Make an API call to a 3rd party service to get the stream, image, title
	c) Make an API call to StubHub for ticketing information
	d) Bundle up the response and return to the UI in JSON format
